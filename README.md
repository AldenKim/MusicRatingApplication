# Music Rating Application
Project to make a Music Ranking Application

Pitch: I want to create a music ranking application that will allow a user to compare two albums, and pick their preferred album, and do that for a lot of different album and derive a ranking off of that. There is not really a collective app for ranking albums that I am aware of (like letterboxd with movies) so my hope would be to bring music listeners together in a community to help rank albums and help write great reviews
Goals:
- Build a nice UI frontend
- Figure out how to best store users, albums, their rankings etc.
- Figure out the math on how to calculate their actual rankings out of ten.

Technologies:
- Frontend in react
- Backend in either python or typescript
- Database would be a SQL based database most likely
